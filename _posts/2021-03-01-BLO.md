In this blog, I will give a summary of the paper ["Competing in the Dark: An Efficient Algorithm for Bandit Linear Optimization"](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/123-Abernethy.pdf) and some of my understandings. As its title suggests, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm for bandit linear optimization, which achieves the optimal $O^*(\sqrt{T})$ regret. This method studies the Hessian matrix of regularization function $R(x)$ to estimate the cost function which shows its connection to interior point methods.

### 1. Bandit Linear Optimization

As introduced in the previous blog, the *online linear optimization* problem is defined as the following repeated game between the learner (player) and the environment(adversary).

```
At each time step t=1 to T
- Player chooses 
```

### Conclusion

### Some thoughts

To be honest, this is a quite hard paper to rea. There are tons of mathemtical concepts and proofs which is not easy to follow. I can hardly say I fully understand all the insights behind this paper. But this is also a good paper that worth reading multiple times since there are many insights and techniques which we can learn.
