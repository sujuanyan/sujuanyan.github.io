In this blog, I will give a summary of the paper ["Martin Zinkevich. Online convex programming and generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent. Proc. of ICML, 2003."](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maz/publications/techconvex.pdf) and talk about some of my understandings. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that introduces the *Online Convex Programming*, which is a generalization of the well-studied experts problem. Besides, A simple and natural method is proposed, namely the *generalized Infinitesimal Gradient Ascent (GIGA)*. This algorithm is straightforward but powerful with certain advantages. The paper first introduces the form online convex programming followed by a greedy projection algorithm. Then the GIGA method is proposed in the context of repeated games. The GIGA method is a generalized version of the algorithm *infinitesimal gradient ascent*, which is originally proposed for repeated games.
