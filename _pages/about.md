I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from ShanghaiTech University. I spent my senior year as a visiting student in the Department of EECS at UC Berkeley. I joined [Prof. Boris Houska's group](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/boris/) at ShanghaiTech University.  My research interests focus on optimization and control system theory.
