I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from ShanghaiTech University. I spent my senior year as a visiting student in the Department of EECS at UC Berkeley. I joined [Prof. Boris Houska](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/boris/)'s group at ShanghaiTech University. In fall of 2019, I am going to Washington University in St. Louis and work with [Prof. Shen Zeng at Systems Theory Lab](https://systemstheorylab.wustl.edu/shen-zeng/) as a PhD Student. My research interests focus on optimization and control system theory.
